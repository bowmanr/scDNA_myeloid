# Single-cell mutation analysis of clonal evolution in myeloid malignancies

Here you will find a description behind our approach to using single cell DNA sequencing to uncover the clonal architecture in myeloid malignancies.  

The final manuscript can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2864-x), and the preprint is also available on [biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.938860v1).  Raw data can be accessed through dbGAP accession [phs002049.v1.p1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002049.v1.p1).

A full tutorial on this project is available [here](https://bowmanr.github.io/scDNA_myeloid/). This work is in progress and is being updated continuously.  If there is something in the paper that you are curious about that is not presented here, I'd be happy to chat.  The more we work with this data, we anticipate that the data processing techniques and appraoches will update over time. So this tutorial will serve both as an explanation of how we performed analysis in the above linked paper, as well as a place for updated data analysis approaches.
