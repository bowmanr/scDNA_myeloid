This is one of the largest projects I have undertaken, and one of the first where I have made a concerted effort to make the code completely available, and easily accessible. I think like most of my biologically-trained peers, the idea of sharing all of the code in the project, and its’ certain inefficiencies, is a humbling process. I am excited to hear feedback on our approach, and am sure there are many places where the code, the approach, and the science can be improved. Given the rate of progress in the single cell field as a whole, I anticipate that many of the approaches we employed here will be quickly updated with new ones as time goes on. Infact, even as we completed this project, sample handling was changed as new R packages were rolled out from the team out at Mission Bio. I’ll keep this updated with our most recent approaches as I anticiapte this will continue to change rapidly. All inquiries on bioinformatic troubleshooting or methodology can be referred to myself (Bobby, bowmanr@mskcc.org, bowman_rl. Linde Miles (milesl@mskcc.org lindemilesphd) is the approrpiate person to direct questions toward for the wet lab work including sample preparation, library preparation and sequencing. For anything else, you’re probably best off emailing me, Linde and Ross (leviner@mskcc.org, rosslevinemd) collectively, we’re all very invested in seeing others harvest more out of this data. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction To begin, I assume that you have read through our paper on Biorxiv, and I hope to update this one day with a link to a peer reviewed journal. I’ll summarize our goals briefly. We sought to: + Understand the genetic makeup of myeloid malignancy on a single cell level. + Determine the number, size, and diversity of clones as disease progressed. + Identify patterns of comutation, and abundance in dominant vs minor clones. + Determine if genetic alterations, alone or in combination, altered the immunophenotype of malignant cells. In order to acheive these goals, we used a commercial platform from Mission Bio called Tapestri. Conflict of interest statements can be found in our manuscript on Biorxiv. In short, this methodology uses single cell droplet encapsulation and barcoded beads to perform amplicon next generation sequencing. We designed a custom panel to focus on the 30 most commonly mutated genes in myeloid malignancies. Full details on the panel and sample processing can be found in the manuscript. A work flow is presented below: Much of the upfront analysis is performed on the Tapestri Pipeline produced by Mission Bio available on the Bluebee platform. I will defer all questions on the exact details of the parameters used in this phase of analysis to the Mission Bio team. I would suggest reading here and here as starting points. Here we will primarily with how the data was processed downstream in R and to the right of the red dashed line. Our primary output from Bluebee as the .loom file which contained a useful formating of the multi sample VCF file produced by GATK. For the publication, this .loom file was loaded into Tapestri Insights, a GUI from Mission Bio that allowed for sample filtering based on parameters described in the manuscript. From there a filtered set of cells were exported from Tapestri Insights, and matrices for each column of the VCF file were produced. I will include some of this code and decription of why we did it this way in an Appendix A, but since then, MissionBio has releassed a convenient R package and I find all future analyses will go from there. So, instead, this guide will use their package, I anticipate some of the data might change from our publication, but I guess we’ll see. "],["data-extraction-and-setup.html", "2.1 Data Extraction and Setup", " 2.1 Data Extraction and Setup This section will explore how we take the data from the tapestri pipeline and process it in R. This was previously done with an intermediate step through Tapestri Insights, however R package development from the Mission Bio team has now obviated that step. For the manuscript, we indeed used Tapestri Insights, but I now recommend the appraoch here. One major file we’ll work with the numeric genotype matrix, which contains numeric values representing: NGT.csv - genotype call converted to categorical (0-reference, 1-heterozygous mutation, 2-homozygous mutation, 3-unknown). Calls are made by GATK/Haplotypecaller. "],["tapestri-library.html", "2.2 Tapestri Package", " 2.2 Tapestri Package The purpose of this section is to demonstrate how to extract the data. We will use the tapestri package. The ‘tapestri’ package is available from Mission Bio here. We’ll use this to read in our sample files. You’ll notice in a lot of the code, we are going to run loops and lapply over all of the samples. For reproducibility purposes, I am going to show a limited example on 5 samples for preprocessing, and later we will load an rds object with all the data in the paper. Critical files used for analysis can be found on google drive here. We’re working on getting all of the processsed and raw data up on dbGAP now.

After that I will walk through some steps we used to process the data a little further. Here we made a decision in the project to focus only on protein encoding SNVs, of course there is likely rich data in the splice mutations and that is for further followup. Importantly, we also made the decision to focus only on cells with complete genotype information, and exclude cells that had missing genotypes for a cell of interest. A complimentary manuscript by Koichi Takahashi’s group at MD Anderson analyzed their dataset, and I encourage whoever is reading this to take a look at their bioRxiv preprint. I’ll update this reference once they paper is published. Our streps for post processing are below: + Filter variants through a blacklist removing recurrent variants that we think are likely sequencing errors + Annotating SNVS for protein encoding functions, and removing synonymous and splice variants + Remove variants that are mutated in &lt;2 cells + Remove remaining cells with any unknown genotypes + Remove variants that are mutated in &lt;2 cells again now that we have removed cells that were low quality processed_SNV_files &lt;-grep(&quot;MSK&quot;,list.files(&quot;./analysis/&quot;,full.names = TRUE),value=TRUE) names(processed_SNV_files)&lt;-do.call(rbind,strsplit(grep(&quot;MSK&quot;,list.files(&quot;./analysis/&quot;),value=TRUE),split=&quot;\\\\.&quot;))[,1] SNV&lt;-setNames(lapply(names(processed_SNV_files),function(x){ y&lt;-readRDS(processed_SNV_files[x]) data.frame(&quot;Cell&quot;=rownames(y), # moving the cell name into data.frame prevents some errors later y$data) # extracts the genotype matrix from the analyte object }), names(processed_SNV_files)) So one important note is that the variant annotation we used in the manuscript was done with Tapesstri Insights. Which was quite convenient as it put out a 1:1 mapping of SNV to amino acid changes, presumably by having a list of preferred TXIDs for each gene. So I’ve outlined what I think is a decent approach to this here.

Figure 1D "],["figure-2-clonality.html", "3.2 Figure 2: Clonality", " 3.2 Figure 2: Clonality We next wanted to determine if a given gene is likely to be found in the dominant clone or only ib subclones. Of course, nearly all mutations found in the dominant clone were also found in subclones. We attempted to find mutations that were exclusively found in the dominant clone, but did not observe any. This is likely complicated by the fact that many subclones are not the most “genetically dense” clone as explored in Figure 3 of the manuscript. We decided to address that with the markov models described elsewhere, and instead classified a mutation on whether it was present present or absent in the dominant clone. library(tidyr) library(dplyr) library(RColorBrewer) library(ggplot2) library(pals) library(cowplot) setwd(&quot;/Users/bowmanr/Projects/scDNA&quot;) final_sample_summary&lt;-readRDS(file=&quot;/Users/bowmanr/Projects/scDNA/data/final_sample_summary.rds&quot;) pheno&lt;-readRDS(file=&quot;./data/pheno.rds&quot;) clone_size_by_gene&lt;- do.call(rbind,lapply(names(final_sample_summary),function(x){ # select the clones clones&lt;-final_sample_summary[[x]]$Clones%&gt;%select(Clone) # Compute the relative clone size Clone_size&lt;-final_sample_summary[[x]]$Clones%&gt;%transmute(Clone_size=Count/sum(Count))%&gt;%pull(Clone_size) names(Clone_size) &lt;- clones[,&quot;Clone&quot;] # Extract the mutations mutations &lt;- colnames(final_sample_summary[[x]]$NGT%&gt;%select(!Clone)) # Identify the dominant clone, which is the last one in this data frame dominant_clone &lt;- clones[nrow(clones),] # Compute the bulk VAF for each mutation VAFs &lt;- final_sample_summary[[x]]$NGT%&gt;%select(`mutations`)%&gt;% summarise_all(funs(mean(.)/2)) # Separate the clone into a deduplicated NGT matrix mut_mat&lt;-final_sample_summary[[x]]$Clones%&gt;% select(Clone)%&gt;% separate(col=Clone,into=mutations,sep=&quot;_&quot;) # Create a composite data frame and turn it into long form data.frame(clones,Clone_size,mut_mat,&quot;Sample&quot;=x)%&gt;% pivot_longer(cols=all_of(mutations),names_to=&quot;Variant&quot;, values_to=&quot;Genotype&quot;)%&gt;% filter(Genotype!=0)%&gt;% # remove WT entries separate(col=Variant, into=&quot;Gene&quot;,extra=&quot;drop&quot;,sep=&quot;\\\\.|_&quot;,remove=FALSE)%&gt;% # For later useage in plotting group_by(Variant)%&gt;% filter(Clone_size==max(Clone_size))%&gt;% #identify largest clone mutate(Clonality=case_when( Clone==`dominant_clone`~&quot;Dominant&quot;, Clone!=`dominant_clone`~&quot;Subclone&quot;))%&gt;% #label clones inner_join(data.frame(&quot;VAF&quot;=t(VAFs), &quot;Variant&quot;=names(VAFs))) # merge with bulk VAF info })) # Tally the number of times a gene is in the dominant and subclone tally_set&lt;-data.frame(table(clone_size_by_gene$Gene, clone_size_by_gene$Clonality))%&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from=Var2,values_from=Freq)%&gt;% mutate(Ratio=Dominant/(Subclone+Dominant))%&gt;% #calculate the dominant ratio arrange(Ratio) # For plotting purposes establish order of the y axis clone_size_by_gene$Gene &lt;- factor(clone_size_by_gene$Gene, levels=tally_set$Var1) # Linde and I spent too much time picking the exact shade of red we wanted for this paper.... color_red&lt;-brewer.pal(5,&quot;Reds&quot;)[5] # For plotting purposes establish order of stacked bars clone_size_by_gene$Clonality&lt;-factor(clone_size_by_gene$Clonality,levels=c(&quot;Subclone&quot;,&quot;Dominant&quot;)) #plot the data ggA&lt;-ggplot(tally(clone_size_by_gene%&gt;%group_by(Gene,Clonality)), aes(x=factor(Gene),fill=Clonality,y=n,label=n))+ guides(fill=FALSE,color=FALSE)+ scale_y_continuous( expand = c(0, 0.0))+ #removes white space near the axis of the bars geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;,position=&quot;fill&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;&quot;)+coord_flip()+ scale_fill_manual(values=c(&quot;Dominant&quot;=color_red, &quot;Subclone&quot;=&quot;grey80&quot;))+ ylab(&quot;Fraction of mutant clones \\n with mutation in dominant clone&quot;)+ theme_bw(base_size=8)+theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) ggB&lt;-ggplot(clone_size_by_gene, aes(y=Clone_size, x=Gene, fill=Gene)) + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5,outlier.shape = NA)+ geom_point(aes(color=Clonality,group=Clonality), position = position_jitterdodge(), size=0.3)+ scale_fill_manual(values=tol.rainbow(n=length(levels(clone_size_by_gene$Gene))))+ scale_color_manual(values=c(&quot;Dominant&quot;=color_red, &quot;Subclone&quot;=&quot;grey20&quot;))+ coord_flip()+ theme_bw(base_size=8)+guides(fill=FALSE,color=FALSE)+ theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank())+ scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1), expand = c(0, 0.05)) + ylab(&quot;Fraction of cells \\n in largest mutant clone&quot;)+ theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) spacer &lt;- plot_grid(NULL) # plot looks better with a little spacer plot_grid(ggA,spacer,ggB,align=&quot;h&quot;,axis=&quot;tb&quot;, ncol=3,rel_widths=c(1,0.05,1)) Figure 3.6: Miles et al.

We start off here by laoding the packages of interest, including two new ones “UpSetR” and “tibble”. UpSetR is necessary for some of the barplots we make, while “tibble” is useful for the add_column function. options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) library(UpSetR) library(tidyr) library(dplyr) library(RColorBrewer) library(ggplot2) library(pals) library(cowplot) library(tibble) setwd(&quot;/Users/bowmanr/Projects/scDNA&quot;) final_sample_summary&lt;-readRDS(file=&quot;./data/final_sample_summary.rds&quot;) pheno&lt;-readRDS(file=&quot;./data/pheno.rds&quot;) Our eventual goal is make an UpSet plot looking at the overlap of the different epigenetic events. We would like to demarcate on this plot whether the different epigenetic hits are in the same clone, with a specific focus on the dominant clone. We’ll start off by determing for each sample whether there is a mutation for the indicated genes. sample_mutations&lt;-do.call(rbind,lapply(names(final_sample_summary),function(sample){ data.frame(&quot;Sample&quot;=sample, &quot;DNMT3A&quot;=ifelse(any(grepl(&quot;DNMT3A&quot;,colnames(final_sample_summary[[sample]]$NGT))),1,0), &quot;TET2&quot;=ifelse(any(grepl(&quot;TET2&quot;,colnames(final_sample_summary[[sample]]$NGT))),1,0), &quot;IDH2&quot;=ifelse(any(grepl(&quot;IDH2&quot;,colnames(final_sample_summary[[sample]]$NGT))),1,0), &quot;IDH1&quot;=ifelse(any(grepl(&quot;IDH1&quot;,colnames(final_sample_summary[[sample]]$NGT))),1,0), &quot;ASXL1&quot;=ifelse(any(grepl(&quot;ASXL1&quot;,colnames(final_sample_summary[[sample]]$NGT))),1,0), &quot;FLT3&quot;=ifelse(any(grepl(&quot;FLT3&quot;,colnames(final_sample_summary[[sample]]$NGT))),1,0), &quot;JAK2&quot;=ifelse(any(grepl(&quot;JAK2&quot;,colnames(final_sample_summary[[sample]]$NGT))),1,0), &quot;NRAS&quot;=ifelse(any(grepl(&quot;NRAS&quot;,colnames(final_sample_summary[[sample]]$NGT))),1,0), &quot;KRAS&quot;=ifelse(any(grepl(&quot;KRAS&quot;,colnames(final_sample_summary[[sample]]$NGT))),1,0), &quot;PTPN11&quot;=ifelse(any(grepl(&quot;PTPN11&quot;,colnames(final_sample_summary[[sample]]$NGT))),1,0) ) })) We will next proceed with this same process on a clone level. clone_mutations&lt;-do.call(rbind,lapply(names(final_sample_summary),function(sample){ # select the clones clones&lt;-final_sample_summary[[sample]]$Clones%&gt;%select(Clone) # Extract the mutations mutations &lt;- colnames(final_sample_summary[[sample]]$NGT%&gt;%select(!Clone)) # Separate clones into mutations, identify the mutations in the dominant clone. # I&#39;m sure there is a more efficient way to do this, but this is what I have. # This might seem a little redundant with the group ungroup and regroup, but the idea # is we want to calculate the relative size of each clone in the context of the whole sample # then identify and remove the WT clone in the rare event it is the dominant clone, or the largest subclone. # In order to then mark the clones as dominant or subclone, we have to ungroup in order to use the context of the whole sample. # Lastly, we group again on the Clones and check whether each clone is mutant for the genes of interest. # We next remove excess columns representing genes and variants and finally remove duplicate rows. # Previosuly each line of this data frame was a variant, and now it is a clone. out&lt;-final_sample_summary[[sample]]$Clones%&gt;% mutate(Clone_size=Count/sum(Count))%&gt;% select(Clone,Clone_size)%&gt;% separate(col=Clone, into=mutations,sep=&quot;_&quot;, remove=FALSE)%&gt;% pivot_longer(cols=mutations, names_to=&quot;Variant&quot;, values_to=&quot;Genotype&quot;)%&gt;% add_column(Sample=`sample`)%&gt;% group_by(Clone)%&gt;% mutate(WT=ifelse(all(Genotype==0),1,0))%&gt;% filter(WT==0)%&gt;% filter(Genotype!=0)%&gt;% ungroup()%&gt;% mutate(Clonality=ifelse(Clone_size==max(Clone_size), &quot;Dominant&quot;,&quot;Subclone&quot;))%&gt;% group_by(Clone)%&gt;% mutate(Gene=do.call(rbind,strsplit(Variant,&quot;[\\\\._]&quot;))[,1])%&gt;% mutate(DNMT3A=ifelse(any(Gene%in%&quot;DNMT3A&quot;),1,0), TET2=ifelse(any(Gene%in%&quot;TET2&quot;),1,0), ASXL1=ifelse(any(Gene%in%&quot;ASXL1&quot;),1,0), IDH1=ifelse(any(Gene%in%&quot;IDH1&quot;),1,0), IDH2=ifelse(any(Gene%in%&quot;IDH2&quot;),1,0), FLT3=ifelse(any(Gene%in%&quot;FLT3&quot;),1,0), NRAS=ifelse(any(Gene%in%&quot;NRAS&quot;),1,0), KRAS=ifelse(any(Gene%in%&quot;KRAS&quot;),1,0), PTPN11=ifelse(any(Gene%in%&quot;PTPN11&quot;),1,0), JAK2=ifelse(any(Gene%in%&quot;JAK2&quot;),1,0))%&gt;% ungroup()%&gt;% select(!c(Variant,Genotype,Gene))%&gt;% distinct() })) Now to check to see if the mutations found in the sample are in the dominant clone.

As you can see, we observe an ability of epigenetic modifications to synergize and persist in the dominant clone, while signaling mutations appear to be mututally exclusive. We wanted to determine clones that harbor 2+ epigenetic modifiers were larger than clones that harbored 2+ siganling mutations. To investigate the clone size directly, we focused on a subset of samples that were mutated for both DNMT3A and IDH1/2 as well as harboring multiple mutations in RAS/FLT3/PTPN11. # Run back the patients we looked at in the network plots patients_of_interest &lt;- sample_mutations_added%&gt;%filter(DNMT3A==1&amp;signal2==1&amp; (IDH1==1|IDH2==1))%&gt;% pull(Sample) dual_mutation_fractions&lt;-do.call(rbind,setNames(lapply(patients_of_interest,function(sample){ # Extract the genotype matrix for each patient NGT&lt;-final_sample_summary[[sample]]$NGT%&gt;%select(!Clone) # Simplfy the matrix to mutant vs non mutant cells.

"],["Appendix.html", "Chapter 5 Appendix ", " Chapter 5 Appendix "],["AppendixA.html", "5.1 Import from Tapestri Insights", " 5.1 Import from Tapestri Insights Here is how we used to do it and what I wrote last time: Our first step is to extract the data from output from Tapestri Insights. To do so, I’ve written a few functions that will be helpful to do this on a long list of samples. As this project grew it becamse clear that this work was better suited for a package. Before that though, looking forward we’ll plan to analyze data using the tapestri R package and integrate formatting from standard single cell rna-seq data in R. For now, we’ll just source a series of functions that can be found in the appendix. I’ll build in explanations as best I can over time. Below I’ve copied directly the README.txt file output from Tapestri Insights, as it most accurately describes the output from each of the files. This folder contains data exported from Tapestri Insights 2.1 application. The following files are included: DP.csv - read depth. The Read Depth per Variant metric is the filtered depth, at the cell level. This gives the number of filtered reads that support each of the reported alleles. GQ.csv - quality scores. The genotype quality score represents the Phred-scaled confidence that the genotype assignment (GT) is correct, derived from the genotype normalized likelihoods of possible genotypes (PL). Specifically, the quality score is the difference between the PL of the second most likely genotype, and the PL of the most likely genotype. The values of the PLs are normalized so that the most likely PL is always 0, so the quality score ends up being equal to the second smallest PL, unless that PL is greater than 99. In GATK, the value of quality score is capped at 99 because larger values are not more informative, but they take more space in the file. So if the second most likely PL is greater than 99, we still assign a quality score of 99. Basically the GQ gives you the difference between the likelihoods of the two most likely genotypes. If it is low, you can tell there is not much confidence in the genotype, i.e. there was not enough evidence to confidently choose one genotype over another. NGT.csv - genotype call converted to categorical (0-reference, 1-heterozygous mutation, 2-homozygous mutation, 3-unknown). Calls are made by GATK/Haplotypecaller. AF.csv - variant allele frequency (# of reads with evidence for mutation / total # of reads * 100) Variants.csv - variant metadata In the weeds a little here to explain a detour It is worth mentioning here on why we chose to proceed in the following fashion, and why we didn’t do all the parsing in R directly from the loom file. When we first started running these samples, there were some incompatibilities with the loom v3 files produced from Bluebee, and the available packages in R that were only working with loom v2. This has now of course been corrected. We considered using python, but the reality was my proficiency in R was significantly greater than python and this was not a tennable solutuon. Going through Tapestri Insights also had two added benefits: 1) efficient SNV to protein identification, and 2) data access for others in the lab who were not quickly pouring into the data in R. Future projects in our lab are likely to bypass Tapestri Insights, and bring loom files straight into R as you’ll see in the DNA+Protein section. Furthermore, as this project progressed, new versions of Tapestri Insights became available, and this led to minor modifications in column names and file names. All of this was parsed in R, and the version of Tapestri Insight did not change the analysis, we just did not rerun &gt;100 samples through Tapestri Insights to make sure it was all formatted directly. This is all to explain why you will see some patchwork code in some of the extraction functions upcoming in the next section. all_samples &lt;- list.files(&quot;/Volumes/LevineLab/Levine Lab/MissionBio_Tapestri/Insights_Output/ASH_Cohort&quot;) blacklist &lt;- read.xls(&quot;/Volumes/LevineLab/Levine Lab/Bobby/Collaborations/MissionBio/From_LAM/Blacklist2.xlsx&quot;) whitelist &lt;- read.xls(&quot;/Volumes/LevineLab/Levine Lab/Bobby/Collaborations/MissionBio/From_LAM/Whitelist.xlsx&quot;) pheno &lt;- read.xls(&quot;/Volumes/LevineLab/Levine Lab/Bobby/Collaborations/MissionBio/From_LAM/pheno_MBio.xlsx&quot;) sample_set&lt;- intersect(as.character(all_samples),as.character(pheno$Sample.ID)) setwd(&quot;/Volumes/LevineLab/Levine Lab/MissionBio_Tapestri/Insights_Output/ASH_Cohort&quot;) sample_SNPS&lt;-lapply(as.list(sample_set),function(x){ y&lt;-extract_SNP_info(x) z &lt;- y[!(rownames(y)%in%blacklist[,&quot;Blacklisted.coordinate&quot;]|y[,&quot;protein&quot;]%in%blacklist[,&quot;Protein.Change&quot;]),] z[,&quot;SNP_variant&quot;] &lt;- rownames(z) z[,&quot;Sample&quot;] &lt;- x return(z) }) names(sample_SNPS) &lt;- sample_set saveRDS(sample_SNPS,file=&quot;/Volumes/LevineLab/Levine Lab/Bobby/Collaborations/MissionBio/Analysis/2020/January/sample_SNPS.rds&quot;) sample_NGTs&lt;-lapply(as.list(names(sample_SNPS)),function(x){ extract_NGT_files(x,sample_SNPS[[x]]$SNP_variant) }) names(sample_NGTs) &lt;- names(sample_SNPS) named_sample_NGTs&lt;-lapply(sample_NGTs,function(x){ rownames(x) &lt;- paste(&quot;Cell&quot;,1:nrow(x),sep=&quot;_&quot;) return(x) }) saveRDS(named_sample_NGTs,file=&quot;/Volumes/LevineLab/Levine Lab/Bobby/Collaborations/MissionBio/Analysis/2020/January/sample_NGTs.rds&quot;) pheno &lt;- read.xls(&quot;/Volumes/LevineLab/Levine Lab/Bobby/Collaborations/MissionBio/From_LAM/pheno_MBio.xlsx&quot;) # Now we filter out any synonymous mutations as well sample_SNPS_filter&lt;-lapply(sample_SNPS,function(x){ x%&gt;%filter(!(grepl(&quot;[=&gt;]&quot;,protein)))%&gt;%filter(!grepl(&quot;ASXL1:p.[DNGPIL]81&quot;,protein))%&gt;%filter(!grepl(&quot;FLT3_INS_chr13:28602226:&quot;,protein)) }) colnames_to_grab &lt;- c(&quot;Variant&quot;,&quot;protein&quot;,&quot;Gene&quot;,&quot;gene&quot;,&quot;allele_freq_loom&quot;,&quot;allele_freq&quot;,&quot;SNP_variant&quot;,&quot;Sample&quot;) sample_SNPS_filter_cols&lt;-lapply(sample_SNPS_filter,function(x){x[,colnames(x)%in%colnames_to_grab]}) sample_NGTs_filter&lt;-lapply(names(sample_SNPS),function(x){setNames(data.frame(sample_NGTs[[x]][,sample_SNPS_filter[[x]][,&quot;SNP_variant&quot;]]),sample_SNPS_filter[[x]][,&quot;SNP_variant&quot;])});
